## Quick example

Consider this example (all authors and quantities are fictitious):

- Doe (2021) published a method for estimating $V_t$ as a function of $q_p$ and $t$.
- Bloggs (2023) published a method for estimating $R_m$ as a function of $V_t$ and
  $\rho$, with the explicit requirement that $V_t$ be estimated using the method of
  Doe (2021) in particular.

The goal for citecheck is that you could implement this as follows:

```Python
from citecheck import enforcecite, Cite

@enforcecite
def calc_vt_doe2021(
  qt: float,
  t: float
) -> Annotated[float, Cite("doe2021")]:
    ...

@enforcecite
def calc_rm_bloggs2023(
  vt: Annotated[float, Cite("doe2021")],
  rho: float
) -> Annotated[float, Cite("bloggs2023")]:
    ...
```

Now, if we try to pass a value for $V_t$ that was not estimated using the method of Doe
(2021), we would get an error:

```Python
calc_rm_bloggs2023(vt=1.0, rho=1.0) # Error
calc_rm_bloggs2023(vt=calc_vt_doe2021(1.0, 1.0), rho=1.0) # OK
```

citecheck is still in development, but this is the general idea.

## When to use citecheck

You should consider using citecheck when you are implementing functions corresponding to
equations or methodologies in multiple papers which refer to one another.

## Getting Started with Development

Use Linux, install [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), and then run the setup
script:

```bash
source .\scripts\dev-setup.sh
```
